# Burn Token Strategy for DAOs

Enables users to burn tokens with registered apps, which can be DAOs, and receive a proportional amount of assigned voting power. This voting power can be used in DAO systems like PeerMe for voting and fair ownership distribution.

This strategy is optimized to enable collective ownership and decision-making, with voting power based on one's burned tokens.
